    "summary": "I am a Fullstack developer who loves to see the big picture but I can also work in great details. I am passionate about technologies, entrepreneurship and personal development. Over the years, I have participated in many hackathons such as Junction, AngelHack, UltraHack, Iot Hackathon, Robot against Humanity Hackathon. In Junction 2017 I was in a team of 4 who won the first prize in one of the companies challenges and got a ticket to attend Slush 2017. In 2018 I was in a team of 3 and we won the first prize in UltraHack Sprint II with the prize of 7000e and 2 Slush tickets. Further development of the project will be supported by VTT and UN. I am constantly and actively improving my skills in software development through learning online courses, attending hackathons, participating tech meetups like HelsinkiJS/ReactJS and I am helping other people to get into software development in coding clubs.",
